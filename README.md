# GreenCode: Promoting Eco-Friendly Coding Practices

## Introduction

Welcome to GreenCode! This project aims to address energy inefficiencies in Python code by promoting eco-friendly coding practices. With the increasing demand for computational resources and the consequential rise in energy consumption, it is crucial to optimize software development processes for sustainability. GreenCode provides tools and recommendations to developers to reduce the energy footprint of their Python code, ultimately contributing to sustainability in the computing industry.

## Features

- **Jupyter Plugin**: GreenCode includes a Google Chrome plugin designed to identify energy-inefficient code segments and suggest alternative practices. The plugin integrates seamlessly with Jupyter notebooks, providing feedback to developers as they write code.

- **Four Identified Coding Practices**: GreenCode targets four common coding scenarios where energy consumption can be reduced: inefficient use of for loops, comparison of different data types, unnecessary exponentiation operators, and inefficient string concatenation. For each scenario, GreenCode offers alternative coding practices to optimize energy usage.

## Installation

To install the GreenCode Jupyter plugin, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to "chrome://extensions/".

3. Enable Developer mode in the top right corner.

4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the "plugin folder" cloned repository.

## Usage

- Once installed, the GreenCode Jupyter plugin will automatically detect energy-inefficient code segments in your notebooks and provide recommendations for improvement. Simply write your code as usual, reload the page, and GreenCode will offer suggestions in real-time.
